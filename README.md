# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict heart disease based on a dataset containing various health parameters of patients. The model uses machine learning algorithms to classify whether a person is at risk of heart disease or not.

## Project Description
This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart disease. The model is trained on a dataset with features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The goal is to develop a reliable tool for predicting heart disease risk. The project was implemented using Python in a **Google Colab** environment.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is derived from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). The dataset contains information about various health factors including:
- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- And more...

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BeyzaDurdu/HeartDisease-Prediction.git
   cd HeartDisease-Prediction

2. Install required Python libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
After installing the required dependencies, you can run the model as follows:
python heart_disease_prediction.py
This will run the prediction script, which processes the input data and outputs the result (whether a person is at risk of heart disease).

The results of the model include the classification of a person based on their health data. The model's accuracy and performance can be evaluated based on metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
